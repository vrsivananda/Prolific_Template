            Thank you for your interest in this study! If you so choose, you will be participating in a study conducted by principal investigator and Dr. Hakwan Lau (UCLA). The purpose of this study is to develop a questionnaire for politicophobia, assess the prevalence and identify related factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we describe the task and instructions below, please note the following four items:
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>1.) PLEASE USE GOOGLE CHROME AS YOUR WEB BROWSER IN THIS EXPERIMENT<br></b>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and other browsers might not display the experiment properly.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>2.) Please resize this browser window NOW so that it fills your entire screen!</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>3.) Please do NOT adjust your browser size after starting the experiment, as this can disrupt proper presentation of the stimuli!</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>4.) Finally, please note that it may take the experiment a few seconds to load!</b>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not need to refresh the page after clicking the button to begin; the screen will change and the experiment will start after a few seconds.
          </p>

            <b>Study:</b>
            <br>
            If you elect to participate in this study, you will be asked to do the following task: answer a demographic questionnaire, a scale on politicophobia and a number of psychological scales. This should take approximately 20 to 60 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important that you complete the study while in a quiet place where you can focus without distraction. Please be sure that you have enough time and are in an appropriate setting beforehand.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with any task requiring that you focus intently on the computer monitor, you may experience some eye fatigue or dryness. Feel free to take a break whenever you need to.
          </p>
