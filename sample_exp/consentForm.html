        <p>
          Thank you for your interest in this study!
          <br>
          <br>
          If you so choose, you will be participating in a study conducted by principal investigator Dr. Hakwan Lau (UCLA).
          <br>
          <br>
          The purpose of this study is to investigate how effectively you can (1) allocate your attention, and (2) report things you have seen.
          <br>
          <br>
          This experiment displays images at various locations in your browser window.  Before we describe the task and instructions below, please note the following four items:
          <br>
          <br>
          (1) PLEASE USE GOOGLE CHROME AS YOUR WEB BROWSER IN THIS EXPERIMENT. Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and other browsers will not work.
          <br>
          <br>
          (2) Please resize this browser window NOW so that it fills your entire screen!
          <br>
          <br>
          (3) Please do NOT adjust your browser size after starting the experiment, as this can disrupt proper presentation of the stimuli.
          <br>
          <br>
          (4) Finally, please note that it may take the experiment a few seconds to load! You do not need to refresh the page after clicking the button to begin; the screen will change and the experiment will start after a few seconds.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Task:</b>
          <br>
          If you elect to participate in this study, you will be asked to do the following task: on every trial, stimuli will be presented to you.  Following the presentation of the  stimuli, you will be asked to judge various attributes of the stimuli, and you might also be asked to rate confidence in your answers.
          <br>
          <br>
          The entire study will last no more than one hour, with break screens that will pop up around every 10 minutes if the study is not self-paced. The expected duration and payment is stated in the mTurk/Prolific ad page. It is important that you complete the study while in a quiet place where you can focus without distraction. Please be sure that you have enough time and are in an appropriate setting before continuing with the study.
          <br>
          <br>
          As with any task requiring you to focus intently on the computer monitor, you may experience some eye fatigue or dryness. You will be given many opportunities to rest and look away from the monitor during the break screens.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Eligibility:</b>
          <br>
          In order to participate, you must be using a computer (this should not be done on a mobile device or iPad), be using Google Chrome as your web browser (Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. will not work), and must have normal or corrected-to-normal vision (glasses or contacts are ok!  Just make sure you are wearing them when you participate in the study).   Please DO NOT participate if you have a history of seizures, epilepsy, or stroke, as the stimuli we present in the experiment will be briefly flashed, and this is a potential (but unlikely) seizure trigger.  Finally, if you have previously participated in an experiment about judging images that looks similar to this one, we would appreciate it if you abstained from participating, as we would like to evaluate participants that have never done this task before.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Compensation:</b>
          <br>
          You will be compensated at a rate of $1.10 for every 10 minutes of the study, with the possibility of receiving a $1 bonus if your performance is higher than that of the previous participant. Thus, if you complete a 30-minute study and earn the bonus payment, you will receive $4 for your participation.
          <br>
          <br>
          You may choose to withdraw from the experiment at any point, and we also reserve the right to terminate your session at any time.  Should you choose to withdraw (or should your session be terminated), you will be paid for the total amount of time you participated at a rate of $1/10 minutes.  For example, if you participated for 15 minutes and then stopped, you would be paid $1.50 for participating. Note, however, that if you withdraw, or if your session is terminated, you will not be eligible for the bonus payment.  Additionally, you will need to email  uclaqualialab@gmail.com, notifying the experimenters of when you participated (please include the day and time in the email) so you can be manually compensated through the mTurk/Prolific system. We will not pay for participation beyond 10 minutes of the expected completion time. Thus if the experiment is supposed to be completed in 30 minutes, we will not pay beyond 40 minutes.
          <br>
          <br>
          You will not directly benefit from your participation in the research study, other than contributing to psychological research.

          <b>Privacy and Confidentiality:</b>
          <br>
          Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can identify you (e.g., age or gender) will remain confidential. It will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by law. Any work performed on mTurk/Prolific can be linked to your profile page. You may therefore wish to restrict what information you share in your public profile. If you choose to contact us directly either at the email address below or through mTurk/Prolific, your email and name may be seen. mTurk/Prolific IDs will not be shared with anyone. mTurk/Prolific IDs are collected solely for the purposes of distributing compensation and will not be connected with the data or shared with anyone outside of the research team.
