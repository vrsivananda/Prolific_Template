          Thank you for your interest in this study!  If you so choose, you will be participating in a study conducted by principal investigator and faculty sponsor Dr. 
          
          <!--CHOOSE ONE (UCLA or UCR):-->
          <!--Hakwan Lau (UCLA)-->
          <!--Megan Peters (UCR)-->
          
          . The purpose of this study is to investigate <!--Purpose-->the demographic of mTurk users<!--/Purpose-->.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we describe the task and instructions below, please note the following four items:
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>1.) PLEASE USE GOOGLE CHROME AS YOUR WEB BROWSER IN THIS EXPERIMENT<br></b>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and other browsers might not display the experiment properly.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>2.) Please resize this browser window NOW so that it fills your entire screen!</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>3.) Please do NOT adjust your browser size after starting the experiment, as this can disrupt proper presentation of the stimuli!</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>4.) Finally, please note that it may take the experiment a few seconds to load!</b>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not need to refresh the page after clicking the button to begin; the screen will change and the experiment will start after a few seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Task:</b>
          <br>
          If you elect to participate in this study, you will be asked to do the following task: <!--Task-->Respond to two simple survey questions.<!--/Task-->
        </p>
        <p>
          The entire study should last about <!--Time1-->1<!--/Time1--> minute. It is important that you complete the study while in a quiet place where you can focus without distraction.  Please be sure that you have enough time and are in an appropriate setting before continuing with the study.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with any task requiring that you focus intently on the computer monitor, you may experience some eye fatigue or dryness. Feel free to take a break whenever you need to.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Eligibility:</b>
          <br>
          In order to participate, you must be using a computer (this should not be done on a mobile device or iPad), be using Google Chrome as your web browser (Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. will not work), and must have normal or corrected-to-normal vision (glasses or contacts are OK!  Just make sure you are wearing them when you participate in this study).  Please DO NOT participate if you have a history of seizures, epilepsy, or stroke, as the stimuli we present in the experiment will be briefly flashed, and this is a potential (but unlikely) seizure trigger.  Finally, if you have previously participated in an experiment <!--Experiment type-->about judging emotions <!--/Experiment type--> that looks similar to this one, we would appreciate it if you abstained from participating, as we would like to evaluate participants that have never done this task before.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Compensation:</b>
          <br>
          You will be compensated <!--Amount-->$0.01<!--/Amount--> for completion of the study.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>You may choose to withdraw from the experiment at any point, and we also reserve the right to terminate your session at any time.  Should you choose to withdraw (or should your session be terminated), you will be paid for the total amount of time you participated at a rate of $4/hr.  For example, if you participated for 2 minutes and then stopped, you would be paid $0.13 for participating. Note, however, that if you withdraw, or if your session is terminated, you will not be eligible for the possible bonus payment. Additionally, you will need to email
            
          <!--CHOOSE ONE (UCLA or UCR):-->
          <!--uclaqualialab@gmail.com-->
          <!--ucrneuralcomputation@gmail.com--> 
          
          , notifying the experimenters of when you participated (please include day and time in the email), so you can be manually compensated through the mTurk system.</b>  We will not pay beyond <!--Time2-->2<!--/Time2--> minutes of participation, as this experiment should be completed in about <!--Time3-->1<!--/Time3--> minutes.
          <br>
          <br>
          You will not directly benefit from your participation in the research study, other than contributing to psychological research.
        </p>

          <b>Privacy and Confidentiality:</b>
          <br>
